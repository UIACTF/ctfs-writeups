**Author:** `Egge99`

## Description

In 1922, a sailor emigrated from Fjære, Norway. Born in 1890, he set off for New York aboard a ship named "Stvr.fj." This sailor left a significant fortune for his descendants, whom we are currently seeking.

We believe we have found the name of his wife, but for the paperwork to be finalized, we need to confirm her last name. Initially, her name was thought to be only two parts, but after further research, we uncovered a third name.

If you can confirm our findings, please submit his wife's last name in the flag format, with only the first letter capitalized. For example, if her full name is determined to be Marthe Eriksen Bratlie, the flag will be: `EPT{Bratlie}`.

## Introduction

### Key Information

**Sailor:**
- Birthplace: Fjære, Norway
- Birth Year: 1890
- Emigration Year: 1922
- Destination: New York
- Occupation: Sailor ("Matros")
- Gender: Male

**Wife:**
- Married to the sailor
- Initially thought to have a two-part name, later found to have three names

## Solution

To begin, I conducted a search on [Digitalarkivet](https://www.digitalarkivet.no), using the database “Emigrants from Kristiania 1867-1927, additions.” I refined the search with the following criteria:

- Residence: Fjære
- Year of Birth: 1890
- Year of Emigration: 1922
- Destination: New York

This search returned two names, but only **Anders Bergqvist** held the position of "g Matros" (sailor).

Next, I conducted a search for "Anders Bergqvist" and narrowed the results to Fjære, Norway. The information aligned with the emigration papers.
- [Anders Bergqvist record](https://www.digitalarkivet.no/en/search/persons?s=Anders+Bergqvist&event_year_from=&event_year_to=&event_date=&m%5B%5D=0923)

Through this search, I found that Anders was the father of **Lillian**, and his wife's name was listed as **Klara Elise**.
- [Record showing Klara Elise as mother](https://www.digitalarkivet.no/en/view/255/pd00000035313470)

The task specified that the wife’s name contained three parts, so I performed an additional search for "Klara Elise" limited to Fjære. The first result revealed her full name as **Klara Elise Johnsen**.
- [Klara Elise Johnsen record](https://www.digitalarkivet.no/en/view/255/pd00000033308424)

Based on this cross-referenced data, I concluded that **Klara Elise's third name is Johnsen**, and the correct flag is:

```
EPT{Johnsen}
